# World-of-Daes
A comprehensive world meant to be a template for duplication. All events and maps done in a way that allows contributors to create written works or games based on the vast historical and geographical data(and my own written works).

# Converting over to Zim Desktop + Git
>*This program is buggy and is unreliable at the moment. Imported all pages in zim. It is a functional db at the moment but I will update the page structure later. Currently everything is a flat list with tags, which, is more of a useful way to browse than the normal browser.*

I just tested it with zim-desktop in one window and Git desktop in the other window. Made changes in the wiki - no save, just typed - instantly shows up on the Git Desktop as a change that I can commit and sync. Aaaahahahahah

If you want to test this and just start writing some stuff, I am only working in the "a a a a" directory for now. Many pages need to be fixed "Fix Page Headers".
1) Right Click the page name (left dock)
2) Rename
3) Click checkbox labeled "Update the heading of this page" (do not change page name)
4) Click "OK"

presto-chango!
