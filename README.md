# World-of-Daes
A comprehensive world meant to be a template for duplication. All events and maps done in a way that allows contributors to create written works or games based on the vast historical and geographical data(and my own written works).

I use Zimm Desktop. download it, and open the Directory World of Daes as a new Notebook.

Currently it is only myself by I would like help. Feel free to contact me.
