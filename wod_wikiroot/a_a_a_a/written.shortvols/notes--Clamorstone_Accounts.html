<br>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<b>Imna Riss</b> - (warm blood)<br>
Scout with a natural ability to alter the passing of time. Her primary function in this story is to foil the attempted assassination on the Cobalt Mantes Lords.. She has been indoctrinated into the Cobalt Mantes and believes in their sovereignty completely. She prevents the initial attack from the Assassin Bug that was hired by and as yet unknown operative working for the Cobalt "Underground".
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<b>Cosur Albig</b> (salt there - salt finder)<br>
part of a superficial branch of the Cobalt that selects the best salts for the Mantis leaders. Gets caught by the Hoonah Wasps. To save his own behind he gives the Hoonah Wasps a small bit of information that was crucial to the plans laid out by its leader to overthrow the Cobalt Hive once and for all. Cosur unwittingly begins a series of events that changes several hives forever.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<b>Inrin Matkra</b> (dance invent - creator of the forms)<br>
develops with the help of devotees the various martial forms known as Sheun, which is beginning to revolutionize the fighting prowess and military progress of the Cobalt "Underground". Serves as a leader to a faction of the Cobalt ants with the express goal of overthrowing the Cobalt Mantes oppressors. Many end up suspecting Inrin Matkra, for her involvement in the military aspect of the growing opposition, for the first Assassination Attempt on the Mantes leaders. This is speculation but Inrin suspects one of her devotees.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<b>Deto Yela</b> (swim born - born to swim)<br>
a solitary outcast of the Cobalt Society at large. The family he comes from is on the lowest branch of the lowest branch in the society. His particular ability, which is rare, allows him to traverse the nearby waters to get to an island where he discovers that he is part of a much larger world. Introduces the ancient relatives of the Hoonah Wasps, the Djanrid Black-Cedar Wasps (also known as The Djandrid Fireseeds, The Fireseeds, Djandreans, Jared_s Fire (as known by the humans, being a poor phonetic translation).

<br>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<b>Bolket Djomen</b> (organise exercise)<br>
The Training Captain of the Landward Sentries of The Third Hive of Nobaen. This is the primary hive from the Hoonah Tribe that is introduced by this chronicle. Bolket is in charge of making sure all of the scouts and war sentries that are stationed on the “land side” of the Hive are fit and ready at all times. His role in the chronicle is to illustrate the mundane and typical responses of the Hoonah military hivemates. When a normal “agressive response protocal” is engaged, Bolket ends up being the one who captures a small Cobalt Ant that knows a lot about ways to get into the hive. Bolket does not believe the ant at first and takes him to the Hive King, Banreed. This transaction makes Bolket a social and political hero among the Hoonah. He is in parades, visits with the queen, a private branch with special servants, the works. That is until it all comes crashing down when the internal, social framework of the Third Hive of Nobaen collapses. An anti-violence group emerges from out of no where and heavily disrupts the hive at the exact moment the military is moving out to capture Kairnmount. Bolket’s version of the story goes that he ran at that moment barely escaping with his life. He then lives out an extraordinarily long life as a wandering monk. It is suspected by some scholars that the existance of the story of Banis Trench is entirely the doing of Bolket. In his long years he traveled to the Fiaine Templae and relayed his story in person to Kuptra Fiaine.

<h2>Cobalt Hive Details<a id="cobalt-hive-details" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
The Cobalt Hive is the residence of the Cobalt Mantes(or Mantreas) and the Cobalt Ants. The hive itself is at the base of a young Fennelknot. In the roots of this tree is a stone that harbors the power to convince any creature in the grips of an aggressive nature toward the bearer of the mineral that its most feared predator is just around the corner and is about to attack. This effectively scares of any attacks from other ants and surely any other creature of the diminutive world. No raid on the Cobalt Hive has ever been successful. In the early days before the Mantes, the Cobalt Ants were a widely loved collective of ants covering vast areas with multiple hives. While there was only one Kairnmount (the true name given to the Clamorstone), all groups respected the power that was wielded there.

<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<img src="file:///C:/Users/Seth/Desktop/_Writing/daes/_srcimgs/threewitches.jpg"><br>
The Mothers Maidens(parasitic ants that were used as a cologne or dope to trick the Cobalt Ants into taking complete and total care of them and ultimately giving over thier power structure and their very will power) were introduced to the Cobalt Hive in the early Second Age (of the Histos reckoning). The Maidens were a strange, feeble ant that could not take care of themselves and needed constant attention or they would quite literally die from lack of attention. The Cobalt Ants could not stop from pampering these Maidens and their “Mother”. A few quiet generations later, several Mantids from the south came and infiltrated the Hive, and took the Maiden Mother. They stole her away for a long time. None of the reports after that point were very clear about what exactly happened. Much of the rebelion began after questions about where the Mother went to, were never answered. 
</div>
</p>

<br>

<h3>Persistent<a id="persistent" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
The content of the reports was deemed false almost in its entirety by the Lanstam Group of the Fornaas Listuary of Lyyndrinas. It was in their commentary considered “A crude reprisal on name and deeds of a noble hive.”. Implying that the Mantes Society had already begun work to dislodge themselves from any documentation that might contain their influence by the end of the Second Age.

<h2>The Cobalt Mantes<a id="the-cobalt-mantes" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
aka The Mantreas or Mantreans
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
In the early years of the Clamorstone(also known as Kairnmount to its local residents). The Mantreas learned how to subjugate the Cobalt Ants through the pheromone powers of the Siimb Ants (a parasitic ant that cannot survive on its own, living entirely off of a host ant population). The Mantreas, as it is currently known, is specifically the spiritual head of the Cobalt Mantes Society.
