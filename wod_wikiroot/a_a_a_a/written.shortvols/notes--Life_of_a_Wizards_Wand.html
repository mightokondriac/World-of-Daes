</p>

<h2>Short description<a id="short-description" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>
The greatest wizard in the world is perfecting the first wand. With his incredible skill and the magic of one of the Star Birds, he crafts the magical device only to drop it down the side of the mountain right after its made. It may have been knocked out. It may have just been the amount of butter on his fingers. No one is completely sure (yet?).  <br>
These stories follow each affected "character" as the wand bounces down the side of the mountain. In essence each bounce is a new story.
</p>

<br>

<h2>What the mountain looks like<a id="what-the-mountain-looks-like" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>
<img src="file:///C:/Users/Seth/Desktop/_Writing/daes/_srcimgs/steep_mountain.jpg" width="646"><br>
This roughly looks like the top of the mountain area. This continues on for a while and then slowly tapers off to an area of land filled with rivers. It is surrounded by several other mountains.
</p>

<h2>Story Ideas<a id="story-ideas" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>
Not in order. This series will take place in the earlier years of the proper formation of Godorand and possibly a bit in the future.
</p>

<h3>Hurricane Eagle<a id="hurricane-eagle" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
An eagle whos wing buffets become as powerful as a hurricane gust. The wind he produces in the brief moment after he gains the ability affects the other creatures/stories in the rest of the series (if applicable..). 
</p>

<h3>Tiny Goat Journey<a id="tiny-goat-journey" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
A goat that is transported to the top of a near by mountain, and has been transformed into a tiny tiny goat with the strength of 1000 tiny goats (his original strength). He must make it back to his family but the journey involves crossing a river and going head to head with two creatures, cross a river, and climb the mountain (at least the foot of it). The goat recieves some help along the way.
</p>

<h3>Man becomes tree<a id="man-becomes-tree" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
A man standing alone on the mountain is turned into a tree and is gifted with the knowledge and experience of every tree that has every grown on Daes. This finally will include the knowledge of how to stop being a tree but the gift will not remain if he choses to be a man again.
</p>

<h3>Transmute Wand to Stone<a id="transmute-wand-to-stone" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
A bit of stone is sheered off from an impact with the tip of the wand. The rock transforms into the Wand and the original Wand transforms into an exact replica of the rock. The rock falls to the ground a few feet down and the Wand continues on. The story is from the perspective of the rock as an intelligent observer that is aware that it was the wand and is now a rock, and is ok with it. Although a little regret seems to creep in when the full weight of the choice that was made, to be this rock, sets in.
</p>

<h3>Star Ants<a id="star-ants" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
Two ants are out foraging and become endowed with masterful mechanical wit and unparalleled vision in the workings of astronomical devices. The leave their hive to persue means to prototype their designs and explore the gallaxy and even the universe. They become instrumental in the creation and development of the field of Astronomical Apparati Diminue (Telescopes for the Kiim races) and most notably the comprehensive installment of libraries all across the continent of Godorand for the Kiim races. 
</p>

<h3>Raincloud comes to life<a id="raincloud-comes-to-life" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
A rain cloud bursts to life, each rain drop is an individual and the whole thing is one entity at the same time. It struggles to not lose itself.
</p>

<h3>Wind Song<a id="wind-song" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
A gust of wind that becomes a song as it moves along through the world and changes based on what it encounters. 
</p>

<h3>(special) Girl Chases Wand<a id="special-girl-chases-wand" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
A girl that sees the wand go flying by and begins to chase it down the mountain as fast as she can. She witnesses and most likely takes part in the next couple/few stories that emerge. She never has a spell cast on her exactly, but the wand does at one point present an illusion of a fairy to help the girl discover the wand up in a tree. The wand falls again and continues its journey down the mountain.
</p>

<h3>New Well<a id="new-well" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
a drop of water that turns into a new well. This well produces its own Ade Mog. The story follows this creature as it struggles to understand its place in the world. 
</p>

<h3>Wish Branch<a id="wish-branch" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
An old knife stuck in a tree is transformed into a flowering branch with metalic leaves. The story follows a little boy who discovers it 5 years later while lost in the woods. The flowers of the branch grant him wishes with amazing results that seem to have no recourse. As an adult he breaks the branch off to take with him as he moves on in life. The branch stops flowering after one bloom since the cutting. He realises his error but its too late.
</p>

<br>

<h3>The Lost Working of the Sagely Serpents<a id="the-lost-working-of-the-sagely-serpents" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
A large book falls from the air directly in front of the main char of this story. This tomb is a manual on how to approach the world in the "Way of the Serpent". - (This is related directly to the wisdom of Tritavas)
</p>

<h3>The Savage Rite of the Intelligent Berserker<a id="the-savage-rite-of-the-intelligent-berserker" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
A section of the rock wall is precision cut-flat and inscribed with the lucid vision of a Beserker of renown. This message entails how to fully enter the state and remain there for as long or short amount of time as needed. This berserker goes on to explain the purified state one must be in to achieve this, as apposed to the standard practice of halucinegens and frantic rage. About 400 years later this knowledge is discovered on the rock face by a young scientist. Deciphering the text was challenging and took roughly a year to produce the first results (presented at the Kal-Met Validation). <br>
After a full account of the Savage Rite had been sitting in a dusty vault for close to 20 years, the rock face was discovered again by some industrious women who had a certain knack for relocating very large and remote artifacts. The two moved the entire wall of text to the Great Amber Hall, where all knowledge of the world is copied and stored for all, to live out the rest of its life.
</p>

<p>
Some of the perspective of the story will be from the stone itself and most from the people involved.
</p>

<p>
This story could have a <b>multipart</b> aspect where:<br>
<ul>
<li><i>the stone is fully understood</i> by a deviant character</li>
<li>"                                                        " positive mentor</li>
<li>"                                                        " group of scholars</li>
<li>the stone is destroyed by a group trying to prevent the spread of savage knowledge.</li>
<li>a savage group preventing their knowledge from being spread to the world</li>
<li>a thief/guild attempts to steal it but is confronted by the original movers of the text. a battle of witts and steel insues.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Innocent Chameleons Invocation of Copper<a id="innocent-chameleons-invocation-of-copper" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>
The wand lands in a tiny pool of water in the crack of a rock that has a chameleon in it. The crack in the rock was the metalic mineral Copper.<br>
A chameleon is given the ability to alter the state of matter to become copper. But only when he is afraid. This will lay out the journey he takes and how the bad guys turn to copper. and how he was called upon to save the world from a creature that threatened to rend the world to bits.
</p>

<h3>Cause and Effect<a id="cause-and-effect" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>

</p>

<p>
The main character hears a series of loud noises and procedes to run toward the mountain. In the spot where the wand lands on the ground, a crystal monolith appears. The wand is perminently inside the monolith except in the rare instance that the greatest wizard who may, with a most powerful spell -and the help of Fate, retrieve the Great Wand from inside the conjured crystal. <br>
The crystal eminates the original source of magic. For Ages this crystal will be a place of reverence and pilgrimage . In the later ages this place that the crystal resides will be a military base that houses the crystal, for it can not be moved or effected in any way, and therefore it is studied and integrated into the modern systems of technology. A rudimentary knowledge of the basics of magic that the crystal could reveal would be handled in a scientific way. This systematic approach to magic basics and the integration with technology turns the world upside down in the matter of years. Soon into the third decade of deep probing of the crystal, a man named Merrit approaches the crystal and is revealed to be the great sorcerer that would be required to retrieve the Wand from the Crystal. This character would have to be an agent of the company that uses the magic. This character then spends time with the crystal for 'mission specific' reasons to gain intel on a target. This target requires a specific set of rules be followed when using certain spells around them. The crystal was "asked" for the answer and it revealed a mountain of information on the subject. Merrit can understand and transmit information very quickly when "connected" to the crystal and spends weeks doing so. At a few points during this transcription, Merrit recieves a large amount of knowledge not related to the question. He spends his "down time" digging further and further into his experience with the extra knowledge that seems to have been imbedded into his mind. At a critical moment in his career and his knowledge from the crystal, which will be connected in specific ways, Merrit will communicate with the crystal and gain the Special Knowledge that brings him to his completed state and then separate the Wand from the Crystal. He takes up the wand and begins a new age of magic in a world that had forgotten it (although they used it and didn't know - this allows him to be connected to everyone in the world that used new phones or tvs or visited public places or watched satelite tv).
