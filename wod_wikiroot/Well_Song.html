[alias: Rentome Evcrota]
</p>

<h2>Effects<a id="effects" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>
If there is a time when a well needs to be guarded by more than its local [Order of The Clemis|Regeants], help is found through the *Song of the Well*. This ancient and stirring melody can "Awaken" the "Binding" within anyone and anything that hears it. If a creature is able, they will come to the aid and protection of the Well in question. However, in many cases, it is hard to get these creatures to leave or to calm the fire that is their passion to remain near the Well. Someone who is in this state is called "Well Bound". The effect of the song lasts for several days(longer for others), and is known properly as *"Rentome Evcrota"* (_Melody of Stone_). It is said that this song was the _first song ever sung on Daes_. Sung by the [Sisters of Stone] to organise and bind the stones themselves into the fashion of deep(some say bottomeless, see "[Oured]") [Wells]. When the song is heard, and there is DNA from an original [Order of The Clemis] in them, they are drawn to the Well and, barring physical limitations, stop at nothing to fullfil their task.
</p>

<h2>Well Bound (Binding)<a id="well-bound-binding" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>
After the Well or Wells have been successfully protected, Regeants may linger for a few day. In these few days, all manner of prior conflict between any of those in attendance is forgotten for the duration of the effect. Additionally, no food or drink needs to be ingested for sustaining life during this time as well. The energy of The Song and the Wells provide all with extra life force during this time. No sleep is needed either, allowing vigilance to remain in all who would protect the Wells. When the effects have waned, all creatures simly "file away from the Well as though sleep walking". No one speaks or intereacts with each other in this twilight period. Everyone simply walks back to where they were when they heard the Song and continue doing what they were doing. In nearly all cases, no individual has any recolection of the Song, defending the Well, or even that any time had passed. Certainly they would find out later that substantial ammounts of time had passed. Some have, in the later ages, sought recompence from a local king or even a known Regeant after a Well Song event. Never have these requests been denied; for if they had this experience, they had unwillingly offered up their own life to save a Well.
</p>

<h2>Hi_Stos Coma<a id="hi_stos-coma" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>
Recorded on several occassions, the Human([Hi_stos]) individuals who were in attendance at the Well after a Rentome Evcrota, are found sleeping around the Well for up to a week after the "Song has Faded". It is not known why, but this seems to happen only with the Hi_stos race and particularly with males. The only females to have been found in this state were bound through social customs(marriage) to a male that was sleeping. If the male was woken up first, the female would rouse immediately. It appears as though the male could remain in this state indefinately. The longest recorded sleep from male in one of these instances was 3 months. Although his clothes and effects were weathered or damaged, the male did not age by any measure, nor did he appear to suffer any loss from the lack of sustainance. (read the story of "[Twilight over Chandahar]") 
</p>

<h2>Well Song Resistance<a id="well-song-resistance" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>
Many have saught a way to resist the Well Song. Only in the most ancient days there were collars(Now worn by the [Sisters of the Charge], as ordered by the [Dragon Emporer] - see also "[Red Collar]") that allowed powerful enemies to remain captive and uneffected by the Song. This was done to prevent the enemy, along with those who would jail him, from waking up(After a Well Song) with no bindings, and escaping, or worse.
