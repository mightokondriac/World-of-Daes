====== Loffin ======

Metal: Copper
Effect/Affinity: Hammer
	It was said that Loffin came to the world as a comet. In seeing that there was but two metals left for he and his brother, Crinn, Loffin sought veins fitting for both of them. When he looked deep into the earth he saw the Tin metal far deeper than any other metal and knew that Crinn would not be able to see it or feel it for it was at such a depth that it was obscured by myriad other elements. He discovered a vein of Copper that ran deep and bore itself near to a trunk of Tin. Loffin called out to Crinn to follow him as he struck through the water and stone as a great hammer of force. For this he sent his love of protection and the force of delving into copper and indeed his energy was spread further as the drops of water are spread when a rock is dropped in it. All over the world for ages to come there were creatures that plied blunt force with their heads to protect their kin, and instruments of copper would be used to strike and form and reach the core of things.
