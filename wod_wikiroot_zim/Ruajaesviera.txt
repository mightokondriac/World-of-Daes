The most common recollection of the Great Tamer is of a colossal brown stagg. To any who knew him beyond his deeds knew that he was in fact much larger and and ethereal, but could impress his will into physical responses on the world. Only the creatures to have touched him directly knew that his physical boundary seemed less confined. This is portrayed in several chronicles by the notion of his giant rack of horns "pressing down" the individual but are clearly not touching anything.
