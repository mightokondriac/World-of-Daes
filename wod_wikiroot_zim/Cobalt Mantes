++ Cobalt Mantes
[alias: Mantreas]
In the early years of the Clamorstone(also known as Kairnmount to its local residents). The Mantreas learned how to subjugate the Cobalt Ants through the pheromone powers of the Siimb Ants (a parasitic ant that cannot survive on its own, living entirely off of a host ant population). The Mantreas, as it is currently known, is specifically the spiritual head of the Cobalt Mantes Society.

(Solitary Monarchy Society)
    The Cobalt Mantes act as the "spiritual head" of the [Mantreas] race of the common Bowing Mantis.
