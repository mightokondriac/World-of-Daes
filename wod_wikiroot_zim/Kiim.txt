++ Kiim

This is the title that was devised by the earliest of the diminutive nations. The name "Kiim" is a combination of two "symbols" known as "Ki" and "IM"(pronounced: "Keh"+"IMM").
Ki = To derive from, to Come from, the state of being made from something, birth.
IM = Over vast distances, large spans of time, a long journey, to have been somewhere else prior -a long time ago.
	In the 442nd [Kal_Met Validation], correlated to modern tounge, the current [Hi_stos] translation this means "Those who come\[came] from the first(beginning of) time."

It is surmised from this translation that the Kiim nations as a whole, believe to be the most ancient of races on the planet. This is most certainly true for creatures who dwell on the surface of daes.
