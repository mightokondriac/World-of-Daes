The wingless wyrme, Goldborn ([Zo_mas]), is known to be the oldest of the [Sun Dragons]; born from the pool of the first creatures of Muwinn of the Sun.

read the full story of [The Scales of Zo_mas] 

A ring made by a powerful force of combined magic to facilitate a mirror to watch and listen to "[The Nevers]"(aka [Nevrenis]). This ring was considered the single most dangerous artifact ever created as it violated directly the rules of the ancient gods; that none could ever espy the Nevers or know their position in the world unless the Nevers came to them in a dream, and even then this information would not be revealed by the Nevers themselves.

++The Tear of Ninaddrah

When Ninaddrah died in the Bitter Pass guarding Ev_Rynndamas and his hammer, her soul and all its energy formed into a crystal and embedded into Ev_Rynndamas cheek and remained there and gave him the soul-sight to peer into the metals he worked and be witness to their movement and excitation.
