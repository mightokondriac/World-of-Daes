++ Order of The Clemis

Many different species made up the original Order. Over time certain species were prone to migration or were for one reason or another forced to move. Many of these wayward creatures pilgramiged, some from great distances, to the ancient [Wells] they were bound to. In some cases, entire generations move to specific Well sites for a time and then move to the next Well.

This is known as "[Well Cycle Migration]". Though many creatures used to do it, primarily only flying creatures fully migrate from one Well to another. Most creatures that still act a Regeants of The Clemis, are found in permenant residence near to the Well they guard, or travel in small groups of 1 to 3.

Most creatures have settled on guarding one or two Wells at the most. Over the years the various species protected the Wells so well that very few new species arrived and made permenant there residence. Most would stay on the "Well Cycle Migration" for generations. 

see [Well Song] for more information.
