The original children of Meark(see [Tears of Meark]) were so powerful that the rest of the [Odem] were forced to divert the share of energy available, meant for the [First Children], into different forms. This great shunting of the [Mearvora] created the [Sleepers](along with various other creatures. See [Ade Mog] for examples. See also [Story Elements]).
This race came into the world asleep. They are born, grow and age to approx 50 years old. At this point they remained in a state of stasis for 50 additional years. After this, the individual sat up. They had to be woken up or they would sit there for one day and then return to stasis for another 50 years. If awoken, the individual would live for 50 years without aging or sleeping. After these years are over, the individual returns to sleep and stasis and the cycle starts over. In essence they are all elders. They retain everything they have learned and while in stasis they refine and clarify all the knowledge they have acquired. When they are first born they are able to learn anything.
After several large generations the Sleepers began to awaken and the length of their stasis waned. In each case, this offspring retained less and less of the ability of its parents but were fast to learn and lived vigorously for around 80 years, sleeping approx one third of that time. These children where to become the beginning of primary humanoid race in the world. Though they had no "chord" -magic, the were exceptionally robust and quick to action.
