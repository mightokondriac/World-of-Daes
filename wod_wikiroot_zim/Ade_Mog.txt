===== Chronicle Introduction =====
The Ade Mog is introduced in Hand of Fate when [[Alinaressa]] discovers she can understand the language of the trees. 

The Ade Mog is only known as one creature of legend in the area of The Well of Dawns. This ancient and nearly forgotten creature called the Ade Mog is a "Precipitant" creature from a handfull of the original Wells, not just one. 

Jodvi is the "Green" Ade mog.
Typically seen as a giant stone humanoid creature, covered with vines, deep set black-emerald eyes and a vocal sound like dripping water and snapping twigs.

The Ade Mog Beast is an incarnate creature made from the energies left over from the creation of the Well of Dawns. It is rumored that there are several Ade Mog Beasts throughout all of Godorand. If this were true, the similarities would have to be nearly exact. Its periodic visibility lends to the idea that the Ade Mog beast is in fact a child of [[Byalinn]] (see [[Odem]] for more information) but has appeared to be derived from the Daughters of Anthis? at the time of the creation of the wells (See [[Reglam Well]], [[Ryyndal]] - [[Lords of Trivault]] series).
Physical Traits



Several dozen accounts have surfaced over the years about an Ade Mog that has golden eyes and its vines are continuously flowering. No confirmed military or scientific expeditions to track and document the Golden Ade Mog has ever been done (as of current time).
