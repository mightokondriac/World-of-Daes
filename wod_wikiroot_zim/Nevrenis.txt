**Metal**: Unknown
**Effect/Affinity**: [[Never Effect]]**

In the times when the children of [[Meark]] who have corrupted the world create an influence so strong that it could tip the balance of the world, the Nevers would use the power bestowed upon them by the Ancient Ones(The [[Anschiant]]) to disolve the timeline in that specific time and place. All knowledge and influence on any part of the world are immediately and irrevokably removed from existance. This is known as "The Never Effect" by entities outside the normal boundries of the mortal existance. The [[Odem]] know and feel intimately that the timeline is being tampered with but unless their perception is wholely focused on the subject at hand, the knowledge of the action soon slips from all memory on the planet.

Neverenis was sent to guard the minds of the [[The Meardema|new metals]] brought about by [[Meark]], and all of their creations, to ensure the protection and abidance of the One Law; "Love this World, and with that love, bring love into the minds of those you harbor".
Although the metals created byu meark were pure creation.
