Herein is written some of the lore and sayings passed down about the deeds owed to the Odem.

Lore of [Klanik]

*Alternate Names*
Storm Rider
Storm Blade
Ryyndalkin Klanik â€” or just Ryyndalkin
Albeit a misnomer as Klanik is not a direct kin to Ryyndal, strikes of lightning, (which in reality are not actually his doing --when natural) in many cases cause fire; the principle aspect of Ryyndal.
Andgad (Allmind - for all brains run on electric currents and Klanik can know them)
Lightning Lore
When a thunder clap is heard: "The Word of Klanik!".
When lightning strikes down a tree and it bursts into fire: "Klanik waters the Ryyndal Flower.".
When lighting strikes and no sound is heard: "Klanik_s blade is stealth."
When a man or beast is struck dead by lightning: "Storm rider, your child sees you!".
When lightning runs through water: "She(Anthis) bears the blade of Klanik!".
