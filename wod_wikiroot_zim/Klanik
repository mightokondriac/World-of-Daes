++ Klanik
[alias: Storm Rider]
[alias: Storm Blade]
[alias: Ryyndalkin]

Metal: Nickle
Effect/Affinity: Shock
    In the growing tumult of energies flowing from sky to ground, from ocean to moon, there was a great strike of lightning amidst a swirl of clouds. Klanik was enamored by this and it became his thought and his love as he entered into Nickle, for he desired to touch all things like Anthis and create new paths like Maerk. Like lightning is a great release of stored energy, Klanik bore into Nickle the power of sending out to that which wants to be receiving. Klanik is heralded as both a bringer of destruction --for his bolt can be mighty in effect, and as a catalyst for the teachings of all the Odem to those who would wish to receive knowledge.
