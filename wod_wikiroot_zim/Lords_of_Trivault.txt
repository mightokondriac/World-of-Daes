++ Lords of Trivault
[alias: Trivault Lords; The Lords of Trivault; First Children]

The Lords of Trivault were created within the power of the [Reglam Well] in the Anteroom of the [Great Forge of Ryyndal]. Together with the will of the [Odem], the Master Artificers known as the [Brothers of Metal] worked blessed [Ingots] of pure metal into the visage of the new Lords. These shapes were then dropped into the Reglam Well of which there was no known bottom(see [Oured]). One by one the Great Lords of Trivault came forth in a ring around the well and there took council with the Odem and the Brothers of Metal stood witness. In the council, the Lords of Trivault were charged with bringing order and education to divergent creatures that would soon be traversing the world.
