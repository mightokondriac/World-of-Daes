++ Legends of Uracram

Chronicles by [Epochs of Daes|Age]

+++The First Climb
a heartwarming story about the first time Uracram tried to climb a mountain ridge. He struggles for a time, but when it seems like he may just give up (from sliding back down over and over) something inside him clicks and he runs so hard and so fast up the cliff that he doesn_t just make it up, he makes it to a higher point on the sheer edge of the cliff than anything had ever gone before, save bird kind. He finds up there a torrent of choices and feelings. An Aerighawk nest was a few steps away from him and all he had to do was snatch up the eggs. What he decides will be remembered by many.
