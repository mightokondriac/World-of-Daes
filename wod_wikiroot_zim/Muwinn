++ Muwinn

Metal: Gold
Effect/Affinity: Sun
    When the bold beauty and majestic glitter of gold came into the mind of Muwinn, She rejoiced. She entered into it with the gift of light to be borne unto all who would carry it, for there was an rich cloak of darkness in every corner of the world in those early times. She heard the thoughts of Kam and knew the world would remain in ignorance if there was no light to shine on the pages of the book of knowledge; Of things known and to be known --and so shone forth magnificent light. Through her all of proper ability are able to learn that which light gives meaning to. Her brothers are Byalinn and Ordrinn who came later upon seeing the success of her purpose.
