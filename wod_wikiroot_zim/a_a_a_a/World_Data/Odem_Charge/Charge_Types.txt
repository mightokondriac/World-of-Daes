The abilities that are passed down in various forms and degrees to any living creature. Each Odem has a metal or metals(see Meark) associated with them and each of those metals have an ability associated with them. The following are the abilities from those metals.

===== Meardema Charge Types =====
This category only applies to the Odem Kam.

==== Wind ====

==== Chronicle * ====
 *_{This Charge Type has only ever effected the [[Fiaine Legacy]](original chroniclers from the Kamwell, or more commonly known as the [[Well of Dawns]]).}

	Primary Odem: [[Kam]]
	Assoc. Metal: [[Metal Types#aston|Aston]]

Effect Description

* Genetic
	Chronicle - Remember everything that has been learned in all generations of the bloodline.

* Raw Ore
	While held, this mineral imparts an enhanced ability to retain information learned or experienced.

* Smelted
	While held or worn, this metal imparts a clear recollection of information learned or experienced by anyone who has held or worn the metal while in its current state. The wielder of this information cannot retain the information however, unless the first rule of Endrach is excersized on that information within one week of recalling it.

* Alloyed
	Aston can not be combined with any other metal.

* Worked

* Joined
	The Mirodem is accessible only to those who have devoted their lives obediently to the Laws of Endrach (and thereby, of Kam) for at least 30 years. Any who try to access the original spirit that do not qualify will be met with silence. On the third attempt, if failed, the one attempting will be wiped of all knowledge and memory of the way to access Kam and will forever be faced with confusion and loss from any attempt at using the metal for its regular purposes.

==== Sun ====
	Primary Odem: [[Muwinn]]
	Assoc. Metal: Gold

Effect Description

* Genetic
	In darkness, a nearly blinding light can shine forth from the crown area. The exact source is impossible to ascertain. The rays of light are healing, can carry information, sustain natural environments, and are rather warm. In great numbers, the collective brilliance can blind anything looking at the totality. In groups the healing attribute of the light is magnified into a complete emotional and spiritual healing as well as physical. A non-Sun creature within the radius of the rays receives this healing(the experience can be so intense that in some creatures the mind will fall asleep to allow the body, mind and heart to heal. If the creature fights this sleep, the healing will not take effect)

* Raw Ore
	Will shower bright sparks when struck. If worn or held during sleep it will offer restful sleep filled with dreams of sunny days and warm safety.

* Smelted
	Enhanced vision for a limited time; When held or worn for an extended amount of time, the holder will have the ability to see the living entity of intelligent metals.

* Alloyed
	Imbues the alloy with a slight ghostly glow. A slight increase in visual perception when held.  

* Worked
	Creates a chance of a spark so bright when the metal is being worked that it can draw in the soul of a curious entity. This soul can then remain in the worked piece for as long as the object is still intact. This item will be able to communicate with anyone that holds it. However, any creature of suitable intelligence holding it will be able to confer perfectly and flawlessly with the entity. 

* Joined
	Prolonged connection allows for roaming sight amongst all who are rightly connected through blood or ceremony to Muwinn. Additionally, sustained vision of the living entity of metal.

	No. There is no ceremony that can connect one directly to Ordrinn(This is supposed because the power bestowed by Ordrinn would be too dangerous and was shunted by the Nevers to prevent the imbalance of the world. See: Ages: Second Age) However, if one should hold or wear a pure crown or ring of Eilon for a minimum of 20 years, that one would garner the ability of a Star Creature.
