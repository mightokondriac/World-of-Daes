**Timeline**:
	Between Ages 0(Age before Ages) through 1 with Blood and Bone (Book 3) ending in the beginning of the Second Age.

**Teaser**
In the most remote of times the Brothers of Metal and the Sisters of Stone forged the shape of the world. Through their joy and toil came the shape of the minds and bodies of all that would come after on Daes.

(come up with a way better teaser about a creation of a world that got hacked right at t h e moment of conception. This world has a creature of ultimate evil that must be balanced out, but could complete balance have been achieved without this discord? who knows.)
