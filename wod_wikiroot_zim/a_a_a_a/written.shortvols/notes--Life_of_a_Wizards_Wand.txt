====== notes--Life of a Wizards Wand ======
Created Wednesday 24 January 2018

====== Story Ideas ======
Not in order. This series will take place in the earlier years of the proper formation of Godorand. 


==== Hurricane Eagle ====
An eagle whos wing buffets become as powerful as a hurricane gust. 

==== Tiny Goat Journey ====
A goat that is transported to the top of a near by mountain, and has been transformed into a tiny tiny goat with the strength of 1000 tiny goats (his original strength). He must make it back to his family but the journey involves crossing a river and going head to head with two creatures, cross a river, and climb the mountain (at least the foot of it). The goat recieves some help along the way.

==== Man becomes tree ====
A man standing alone on the mountain is turned into a tree and is gifted with the knowledge and experience of every tree that has every grown on Daes. This finally will include the knowledge of how to stop being a tree but the gift will not remain if he choses to be a man again.

==== Transmute Wand to Stone ====
A bit of stone is sheered off from an impact with the tip of the wand. The rock transforms into the Wand and the original Wand transforms into an exact replica of the rock. The rock falls to the ground a few feet down and the Wand continues on. The story is from the perspective of the rock as an intelligent observer that is aware that it was the wand and is now a rock, and is ok with it. Although a little regret seems to creep in when the full weight of the choice that was made, to be this rock, sets in.

==== Star Ants ====
Two ants are out foraging and become endowed with masterful mechanical wit and unparalleled vision in the workings of astronomical devices. The leave their hive to persue means to prototype their designs and explore the gallaxy and even the universe. They become instrumental in the creation and development of the field of Astronomical Apparati Diminue (Telescopes for the Kiim races) and most notably the comprehensive installment of libraries all across the continent of Godorand for the Kiim races. 

==== Raincloud comes to life ====
A rain cloud bursts to life, each rain drop is an individual and the whole thing is one entity at the same time. It struggles to not lose itself.

==== Wind Song ====
A gust of wind that becomes a song as it moves along through the world and changes based on what it encounters. 

==== (special) Girl Chases Wand ====
A girl that sees the wand go flying by and begins to chase it down the mountain as fast as she can. She witnesses and most likely takes part in the next couple/few stories that emerge. She never has a spell cast on her exactly, but the wand does at one point present an illusion of a fairy to help the girl discover the wand up in a tree. The wand falls again and continues its journey down the mountain.

==== New Well ====
a drop of water that turns into a new well. This well produces its own Ade Mog. The story follows this creature as it struggles to understand its place in the world. 

==== Wish Branch ====
An old knife stuck in a tree is transformed into a flowering branch with metalic leaves. The story follows a little boy who discovers it 5 years later while lost in the woods. The flowers of the branch grant him wishes with amazing results that seem to have no recourse. As an adult he breaks the branch off to take with him as he moves on in life. The branch stops flowering after one bloom since the cutting. He realises his error but its too late.
