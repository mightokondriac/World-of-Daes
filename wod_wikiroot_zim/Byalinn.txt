	When Byalinn had seen his fair sister Muwinn enter the world and had shone her love for the light in its beaming brilliance, he became then aware of another light; the moon. He knew of all things of reflection and duality, and therefore was aware of the bright stars shine being the brilliance of the moon. However it had such a beauty and his love was of remembrance of keen brilliance, he entered into the silver which reminded him most of the moon, and gave to it the power of bringing forth light when sunlight had hence been removed, and of being removed from sight when the brilliance of light is in full view and known to the seer.
