The red clawed sparrows of the Well of Dawns.
The Redclaw were all but wiped out completely from Daes in the 2nd Age when there was treachery amongst the flock. This lead to the learning of False Thought(see [[Redclaw Deception]]) which corrupted them, leading to the total dispersal of thier kind. Some still have traces of their lineage in the common Red Footed Broadbeak Sparrow in the Southern Great Basin, However these birds retained none of their original Chronicled knowledge, or at least they know not how to access it. 

Common Lore:
It is said by various shamans of the Kiim and Humanoid races that claim a benifit in remembering lost memories through a complex mixture involving the ground up claws of the Red Footed Broadbeak Sparrow.
