++ The Ten Fires Staff

Of [Nere Fareh_dis] (\NEEReh \FAHRAHdis) -Gentle Silverbranch), from the Kingdom of [Kali_diem] when she journeyed to the mountain of [Mout_lindem] (MOOT-\LINDem. -Tall Roots) to seek the [Lem Parea] (LEHM PAHRAH -Ten Fires), a staff made of [Helepion] and set with 10 [Cies] (KICE -heart) stones which inherited the Helepion mineral. She found the staff after many perils and seeing all but three of her closest guard perish at the foot of [Apis em_Diet]; a terrible beast of a thousand darkened spikes threw forth endless spears of lightning at her in retaliation to her theft, was so named "Siche em_Selai hald_Reuda Grouch" (The meaning is "Terrible beauty stood pounding", or for short "Hald_Reuda Grides" -"Stands Pounding".) for Nere saw its terrible beauty as a massive stagg shaded by the night and she screamed its new name, with a tear falling from her eye to the ground; she called upon the Lem Parea, and sundered the mighty stagg_s thousand spikes with the fire of the [Anthis], leaving it shunted and cowering in its sudden vulnerability -and it limped away into the dark places of the mountains of [Apis Nah] and was not seen again for a very long time. Nere returned to Kali_diem with the staff and her city was saved from the wrath of the [Ros dit_Vis] - The Dark Port, a shadow that ravaged the western coastal areas. It was always shadowed and could not be seen except when it was in the throws of destruction. It was at last in that moment when the shadow passed over Kali_diem and was laying to ash the ancient forest south of the city; Nere strode out from behind the [Durrand Wall] and smote the Dragon of Shadow and Ash -visible, and was grim to behold in its quailing as it crashed to the ground, cleaving the western shoreline of the [Bay of Kyaman]. Struggling with no tail, nor its back legs, it paddled across the bay to the [Tree-Brand Isle] and upon reaching its shore; It shuddered and, at length, and died of mortal wounds.
