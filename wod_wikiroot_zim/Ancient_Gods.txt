	In the time of the metal, there were other gods who formed and created the worlds and the [[Odem]] abided them in their omnipotent powers. It is said, by the first minds created by the Odema, that the unnamed gods of the world, and indeed the universe, invited the Odem to the spheres of rock and water formed out of the darkness; to bring variance and intelligence to the world in myriad forms. The original gods pleaded to the Odem; "_The beauty of this world is manifold and we have created this garden of many rows and chambers for you to distribute your will in the creation of beings to live and become cultured as one with this garden._"

	The Ancient Gods faltered when [[Screegund]] was born as one of the [[Lords of Trivault]]. Being an Odem, Screegund was intended to remain as incorporeal. Through his devious actions, he was able to trick one of the [[Sisters of Stone]] (also known as Daughters of Water) into believing in his Ingot of metal, bringing him to life. This Sister of Stone was subsequently turned into the first [Neverenis] corporeal many thousands of years later. The unbalance of the world was created when the [True Lost Ingot] was supplanted by the [Ingot of Screegund]. This Lost Ingot fell down the [Reglam Well] into the deep and eventually passed into the "[Oured]"(an unsyncronized position in time and space, relative to the common word "Void"). It is not certain if the Ingot will ever be found again, even if Screegund is wiped from the face of the world. 

	When [Meark] created the [Meardema], the Ancient Gods were forced to create [Neverenis], or "The Nevers" to balance out the world. They had created the Nevers when Screegund was born as a Trivault Lord, but never fully implimented their aspect into the world; remaining only as a failsafe should Screegund fully oorrupt the design laid out by the Ancient Gods.
