====== Sharpwing Fiaine ======
Created Wednesday 13 July 2016

See Fiaine Legacy for more information

The Sharpwing Fiaine were the first of the Fiaine to reach out to other nations to learn from them. They then tought the [[Thornskin Fiaine]] how to accept others as the source of all knowledge. Through their actions, the Fiaine House became the most widely known and respected of all the major Houses, simply due to their willingness to travel and learn from others. The Sharpwing were the first to learn the knowledge and skills of the humanoid races, allowing them access to things they could learn and yet never be able to use. This lead to the proliferation of the [[Fiaine Legacy]].
