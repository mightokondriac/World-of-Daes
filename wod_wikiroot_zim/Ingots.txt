++ Ingots

Throughout the [World of Daes], there are countless records of "Blessed Ingots". These ingots refer to a couple of different things, depending on what you are talking about.

In reference to the "[Lords of Trivault]", the Blessed Ingots are refering to the ingots of metal used by the [Brothers of Metal] and the [Sisters of Stone] to form the shapes of the Lords. 

In any other referral, the Ingot is simply a purified and convieniently shaped metal for working.
