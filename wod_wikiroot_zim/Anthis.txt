++ Anthis

Metal: Sishion
Effect/Affinity: Water
	The deep blue/green of the Sishion were in the thoughts of Anthis at her coming; of the waters of the ocean which were he love upon first sight. Never before had the waters been recognized by a living creature and by this her thoughts were sent to every corner of the world to feed life into the cracks and cool the motions of the stone and fire. Although her motions were to give life, like Ryyndal, they were also interlaced with change and adaption, beating the shores and thereby would eventually show the veins of minerals as they broke from their holds at those exposed places, filling the waters with the minds of all the Odem. While Kam is considered the most high, the Mirodem, Anthis is beloved by all the Odem and all creatures of the world for bringing the minds of the Odem into the blood of the manifest lifeforms that dwelt in those places.
