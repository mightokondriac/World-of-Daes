====== Royal Bearing Points ======
@shortvol @historical @godorand @thirdage @breakmedown

The Bearing Points were created at the beginning of the [Third Age] at the height of the [[Mea Adrynn]] (Sky Born rule, when the dragons began to rule). They were originally designed to be compasses that were linked with specific metals in the [[Eladrimae Dragons]], allowing the dragons to always know exactly where they were, enhanced their magic, and allowed a seamless consciousness between groups on the ground and the sky.

At the end of the [Fourth age], the North and South bearing points were destroyed. In the south they were destroyed by the ancient Akel of [Dyynestra_eal] (now known as [Kalestra]) in an assassination attempt at the western [Lord Muak_adreon] of [Rhistminanis] (now [Talonbrook])-- keeper of the [10 Seals of Tondol], holder of the [Staff of Nin]; Artifacts of power that kept balance in the western lands and held sway over the dominion of the [Night Men] of [Waeroth Mountain] ([Waerothgima]) â€” who in their endured suffrage of the evil that dwelt there, were corrupted and became a scurge upon their land. Akel used the bearing point to locate Lord Muak while on his dragon. Once found he sent a surge of energy through the channel to destroy his (and his dragon_s) mind. This failed but for the destruction of the southern bearing-point and the withering of the link between dragons and men.

Akel faced a simultaneous retaliation from all dragons and the [Four Dyynis Nations] (The united first law keepers), but the damage to the bearing system was resolving around the world. Akel was in command of many creatures but was not of the royal house of Dyyn and the eastern shore was saved the wrath of the coming war. Akel_s armies, if they could be called that, held the mountain range of [[Balasindra]] for several years before he was utterly destroyed and his minions scattered.
