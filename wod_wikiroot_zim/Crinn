++ Crinn

Metal: Tin
Effect/Affinity: Tremor
    Although the power and protection of his brother, Loffin, kept his heart from faltering, the thoughts of Crinn could not help but to be scattered. He sent out his energy into the far wrought corners of the world to feel what his elder brother already knew in his mind. He dove deep into the movements of the water and of the earth and the shifting of the storms and felt them in his mind with sharp, bitter acuity. This was held in his mind as his brother thrust him into the Tin metal before he could think of anything else. Thus, Crinn set into Tin the power of feeling all the tremors of the worlds movements. Of all the Odem, Crinn was entered into the largest of the veins of metal. It was known as the Chotus ol_Piaxan "Column of Feeling" and was deep inside the earth where it could feel all the vibrations of Daes.
