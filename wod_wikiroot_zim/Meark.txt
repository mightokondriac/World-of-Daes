++ Meark

Metal: Iron
Effect/Affinity: Compounding
	Though others of the Odem chose the brightness and that which lies on the outside of things, Meark looked to that which governs the movements of all things. It was his love that in the center of so much beauty there must reside a tumult of density and chaos that flings forth the waves of energy to bind and shape. In his passion for these things he gave to Iron a thread of chaos that can reform its bonds and become something higher than itself. Thus it is said that all metals have their heart in Iron, whence they were born in the stars. When Meark awoke in his first vein, there was a deep sadness in him, for there were so few metals to express, and that he wished to field more halls for his brethren to express themselves in higher form. So it was therefore that Meark created the "Tegilixa".
