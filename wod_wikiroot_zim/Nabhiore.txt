====== Nabhiore ======

Metal: [[Hiorebon]]
Effect/Affinity: [[Night Effect]]
	When [[Muwinn]] came to the world, Nabhiore was quickly behind her and saw the beautiful darkness and its richness scattered. He looked upon the ever shifting darkness and was distraught at the lack of consideration that it had. In his thoughts upon entering the shaded silver, he sought to allow shade to have a place in the sun without fearing its rays, to stand tall in the brightness of learning while keeping the original state of the universe itself; black eternal. Although constant and enscripted to the design of the universe; Nabhiore must wane in the movement of the light. Yet all around, his presence remains.
