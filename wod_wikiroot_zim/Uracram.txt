++ Uracram

One of first [Leopard Stallions], born from the cataclysmic union of [Raclem Eviticacha] and [Rastasqek]. His two brothers were [Niis], [Raekram]. His sister was named [Prigrai]. His two brothers always harassed him for not being a girl and upsetting the balance of two boys and two girls as was the way of her mothers race. For the most part they did not recognize the "stallion" part of their heritage from their fathers side.
It was difficult to find even the slightest indication of Raclem_s blood in those children. This was however impossible, since Raclem didn_t have blood, and it was the energy alone that he gave to Rastasqek. However on their 10th cycle, when they were gathered together from far and wide, It became all too apparent.

The few friends who were there were never quite the same around the children of Rastasqek. It was said that on that terrible night, a spirit of a white stagg came forth from the fire and stood with its hooves on the blackened stones around it. In that moment, all of the children changed into stallions. Their forelegs cracked and bent forward. Their heads and jaws elongated. Their chest cavity grew. A mane sprouted down the back. Everything else stayed as it was, if not stretched or bulged some, from the change. It was a quick experience, but forever scarred their mother, who desperatly tried to remembered Raclem but could recall nothing from the time before she was pregnant. All she knew was a name; Racelem. Master. She assumed it was a sign that her children were from a divine lineage, but was never sure until the day of the [Stagg in the Fire].
